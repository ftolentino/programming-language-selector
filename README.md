## Technologies Used

* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _Bootstrap_
* _JS_
* _jQuery_
* _Github_

## Description/Goals

_Create an application for people interested in coding to decide which language they should learn first. Keep in mind that even though all languages have similarities and switching between languages and platforms is very common in both internships and jobs, applicants should still put some thought into which language they should learn._

_Create a Programming Language Suggester webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery) that asks future students a series of questions about themselves and provides a language suggestion based on their answers. You can ask questions about the languages themselves, the kinds of environments where these languages are used, or anything else you find relevant. Note that you are not required to research the languages extensively and you can even choose silly or irrelevant questions to determine which language would be best - for instance, people that like singing in the rain may prefer Ruby while chihuahua lovers might prefer C#._

## Objectives

* _Site uses branching to return the result._
* _Form gathers input from the user._
* _jQuery is used to show and hide the result after the form has been submitted._
* _Variable names are descriptive of what they represent and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample)._
* _Web page is styled using custom CSS._
* _Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state._
* _The promptâ€™s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _git clone **repository link**, to your local machine._
* _requires an internet connection to run (Bootstrap and jQuery are using a CDN)_
* _open the index.html file in your browser, or run Go Live in VS Code to run the code on your local host._
